# AdSilencer for YouTube

The purpose of AdSilencer for YouTube is to provide an alternative to traditional ad blockers that completely block ads from playing on YouTube videos. While ad blockers can be effective at stopping ads, they can also harm content creators by denying them their ad revenue.

AdSilencer for YouTube allows users to enjoy watching videos while still supporting content creators by allowing ads to play in the background [ You won't be able to see or hear them.]

This extension works by injecting a small script into the YouTube page that hide the ads and mutes the audio.
